# Katmandu---PhP
My own little cat store. If you by any chance believe this page was built with irony in mind, you're mistaken. So mistaken. 
The page was built with PHP, HTML5 and CSS in a MVC-pattern. And doesnt work correctly without a MySQL-database, which I lack since I graduated from my university.
